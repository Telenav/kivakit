### Summary <a name = "summary"></a>

This project enables service *registration* and *discovery*. A service, in this context,  
is any application assigned a port on a particular host through registration. Services  
are visible for discovery within a particular scope (local, cluster or network) and  
service discovery can also be limited to a scope (all the services on the local host  
or all the services on the network). Services also provide metadata, including a type  
and version, which allows further scoping of searches. The protocol for the service  
is not defined by this API.

*Servers*

1. Register services on a dynamically assigned port on the local host
2. Provide metadata for those services to guide discovery

*Clients*

1. Discover services within a scope (local, cluster, local area network)
2. Provide criteria for discovery (service type and version)

Both servers and clients use the
[*ServiceRegistryClient*](https://github.com/Telenav/kivakit/blob/master/kivakit-service/client/src/main/java/com/telenav/kivakit/service/registry/client/ServiceRegistryClient.java)
to perform these tasks. 

The *server* module contains the *ServiceRegistryServer* application, which provides  
registration and discovery for clients, both locally, and on a cluster or the local area  
network as a whole. The application is launched automatically by the *ServiceRegistryClient*  
if it is not already running. A service registry server for a local area network or cluster  
needs to be set up manually.
