### Setting Up for Development &nbsp; ![](../images/box-40.png)

If you are helping to develop KivaKit this page will help you get set up.  
If you haven't set up to build KivaKit, see [KivaKit Setup](../overview/setup.md).

> To keep code formatting consistent and make merges easy, the IntelliJ IDE is preferred.

### 1. Install IDE

Download and install [**IntelliJ**](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

import the settings file.

### 3. Import KivaKit Inspections Settings

In the folder *kivakit/setup/intellij* you will find this file:

    kivakit-inspections.xml
