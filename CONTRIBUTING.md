## Contributing to Telenav Projects

Contributions to Telenav projects should meet the following criteria:

1. A ticket should be opened describing the bug or feature.
2. If the contribution will be extensive or will involve a change in architecture, it should be discussed with a committer first.
3. Feature contributions should be concise and clear, and support the [mission statement](README.md).
4. The pull request should be formatted according to Telenav style (see [release/1.8.2](https://github.com/Telenav/telenav-build/blob/release/current/documentation/developing.md))   <!-- [cactus.replacement-branch-name] -->
5. The pull request should not introduce any warnings (see [developing](https://github.com/Telenav/telenav-build/blob/release/current/documentation/developing.md))

Contributions that don't meet these criteria might be fixed by a committer, or the contributor might be asked to fix any issues.
