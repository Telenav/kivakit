## Contributing to KivaKit

Contributions to KivaKit should meet the following criteria:

1. A ticket should be opened describing the bug or feature.
2. If the contribution will be extensive or will involve a change in architecture, it should be discussed with a committer first.
3. Feature contributions should be concise and clear, and support the [mission statement](README.md).
4. The pull request should be formatted according to KivaKit style (see [developing](../documentation/developing.md))
5. The pull request should not introduce any warnings (see [developing](../documentation/developing.md))

Contributions that don't meet these criteria might be fixed by a committer, or the contributor might be asked to fix any issues.
